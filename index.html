            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Johannes Kepler published the first two of his fundamental laws of planetary motion in <em>Astronomia</em> nova. His third was published in <em>The Harmonies of the World</em> in 1619. These were significant influences in the works of Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">John Napier's discovery of logarithms to assist in multiplication of numbers with many digits is published in <em>Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio</em>. Napier inspired the work of Henry Briggs, who developed the first table of common logarithms.</p>

            <h2>Henry Briggs</h2>
            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Henry Briggs continued Napier’s work following his death, publishing a table of common logarithms to the base of 10 (the Briggsian logarithm). He is credited with responsibility for Napier's logarithm tables being published and for driving their acceptance in the scientific community. He was also the voluntarily anonymous editor of books one through six of Euclid's <em>Elements</em> published in 1620.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">René Descartes published <em>Le Monde</em> with one appendix, <em>La Géométrie</em>, that would later become analytic geometry (which allowed equations to be solved using either algebra or geometry). His work also opened the door to future developments and discoveries that led to calculus.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Blaise Pascal, known for <em>New Experiments Concerning Vacuums</em>, did more than discover the existence of vacuums. His correspondence with Pierre de Fermat on the topic of the dice problem, studied by Girolamo Cardano, formed the foundation for probability theory.<br><br>Also notable is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager" target="_blank">Pascal's wager</a> from <em>Pensées</em>. Although philosophical, Pascal employs probability and mathematics to draw his conclusion to this argument: <q>If God does not exist, one will lose nothing by believing in him, while if he does exist, one will lose everything by not believing...we are compelled to gamble...".</q></p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Sir Isaac Newton began his renowned work in mechanics and physics that was later to become his theory of universal gravitation. During this time, he formulated the beginnings of his three laws of motion. His inverse-square law was deduced from Kepler's third law of planetary motion and his own law of centrifugal force.</p>

Although unproven until hundreds of years later, his theorem led to the discovery of commutative ring theory and the development of algebraic number theory. His work was also significant in the foundation of calculus.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Newton wrote <em>De Methodis Serierum et Fluxionum</em>, the culmination of his work during the Great Plague of 1665-6. Newton is said to have pioneered the calculus of infinitesimals during this time, including finding the area under or between curves (integral) and rates of change and curve slopes (differential). This work was not published until 1736, the root of a fully unresolved intellectual war over who first invented calculus, Leibnitz or Newton. Some claimed Leibnitz plagiarized Newton's unpublished work. Others believed each developed their own ideas and methods, although they do at times translate to each other. During the Great Plague Newton also developed his theories on light, first published in 1672.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Leibniz was also renowned for having published his differential calculus in the journal <em>Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus...in Acta Eruditorum</em>, albeit without proofs. Two years later he published, in the same journal, a paper on integral calculus that included a first printing of the notation ∫.</p>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">Newton published <em>Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica</em>, thought by some historians to be the greatest scientific book known to man. This work, like Euclid's <em>Elements</em>, began with axioms, definitions, propositions, and theorems then offered geometric methods of reasoning (Dunlop, 2012, p. 193). It included Newton's law of gravitation, which explained the motions of planets and moons that Kepler had previously reduced to mathematical form (Kepler's third law of planetary motion).</p>
